            scams, and other nasty things that you can come across

            this page.

            Now, you're lucky that you didnt get hacked from just
            clicking links like this. Next time, before you click
            a link, ensure that the domain of the site, is correct!
            <br><br>

            Spelling mistakes in links are BAD! If you see a mistake 
            in the link, DO NOT CLICK IT!
